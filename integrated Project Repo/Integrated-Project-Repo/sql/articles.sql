Dozens of nations pledged aid after the 7.8-magnitude quake, which hit as people were still sleeping and amid freezing weather that has hampered emergency efforts. Multi-storey apartment buildings full of residents were among the 5,606 structures reduced to rubble in Turkey, while Syria announced dozens of collapses, as well as damage to archaeological sites in Aleppo. \"That was the first time we have ever experienced anything like that,\" said Melisa Salman, a 23-year-old reporter in the southeastern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras. \"We thought it was the apocalypse.\" A destroyed street in Gaziantep The tremor was also felt in Cyprus and Lebanon. The head of Syria\'s National Earthquake Centre, Raed Ahmed, called it \"the biggest earthquake recorded in the history of the centre\". The initial quake was followed by dozens of aftershocks, including a 7.5-magnitude tremor that jolted the region in the middle of search and rescue work. \"We managed to save three people, but two were dead,\" said Halis Aktemur, 35, in Turkey\'s southeastern city of Diyarbakir after the quake that was felt as far away as Greenland. A member of The White Helmets at a search operation in Aleppo, Syria In the southeastern Turkish city of Sanliurfa, rescuers were working into the night to try and pull survivors from the wreckage of a seven-storey building that had collapsed. \"There is a family I know under the rubble,\" said 20-year-old Syrian student Omer El Cuneyd. \"Until 11.00 am or noon, my friend was still answering the phone. But she no longer answers. She is down there.\" Why was the Turkey, Syria earthquake so deadly? Despite temperatures falling below zero, frightened residents in the city were preparing to spend the night on the streets, huddling around fires for warmth.

In government-controlled areas, the toll rose to \"1,431 injured and 711 dead in the provinces of Aleppo, Latakia, Hama, Tartus\", Syria\'s health ministry said. In rebel-held parts of the country\'s northwest, at least 733 people were killed and more than 2,100 injured, according to the White Helmets rescue group. The new toll brings the total deaths in both countries to at least 3,823 after Turkey revised its toll earlier to 2,379. Nearly 14,500 people were injured and 4,900 buildings flattened, Turkey announced. Rescue operations in Idlib, Syria, following the tremor Turkey declared seven days of mourning for the dead. The rescue was being hampered by a winter blizzard that covered major roads in ice and snow. Officials said the quake made three major airports in the area inoperable, further complicating deliveries of vital aid. Monday\'s first earthquake struck at 4.17 am (01.17am Irish time) at a depth of about 18 kilometres near the Turkish city of Gaziantep, which is home to around two million people, the US Geological Survey said. Denmark\'s geological institute said tremors reached the east coast of Greenland about eight minutes after the main quake struck Turkey. More than 12,000 people are injured in Turkey, the disaster management agency said, while Syria said at least 3,531 people were injured. \'People under debris\' Osama Abdel Hamid, a quake survivor in Syria, said his family was sleeping when the shaking began. \"The walls collapsed over us, but my son was able to get out,\" he said. \"He started screaming and people gathered around, knowing there were survivors, and they pulled us out from under the rubble.\" A 10-year-old girl was rescued from under the rubble of 10-storey-building in Osmaniye The United States, the European Union and Russia all immediately sent condolences and offers of help. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered to provide \"the necessary assistance\" to Turkey, whose combat drones are helping Kyiv fight the Russian invasion. Images on Turkish television showed rescuers digging through rubble across neighbourhoods of almost all the big cities running along the border with Syria. Debris is strewn across Gaziantep Castle Some of the heaviest devastation occurred near the quake\'s epicentre between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, where entire city blocks lay in ruins under gathering snow.

Countries in which subscription charges have been lowered include Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Croatia, Venezuela, Kenya and Iran. The cuts apply to certain price plans, with subscription charges falling by half in some cases.

Netflix extends crackdown on password sharing Video streaming subscriptions fall by two million Netflix, which operates in more than 190 countries, has faced increased competition from streaming rivals including Amazon, HBO and Disney. Last year, the firm cut hundreds of jobs and launched a less expensive streaming option with adverts as it fought to grow its share of the increasingly competitive streaming market. In January, Netflix co-chief executive Greg Peters outlined how he planned to attract more subscribers. \"We want to make that spectrum even wider as we seek to serve more members around the world and trying to deliver appropriate value at those different price points,\" Mr Peters said. The company is also cracking down on people sharing their subscriptions. Netflix introduced limits on password sharing in more countries earlier this month. These require customers to pay an extra fee if they want friends and family who don\'t live with them to share their subscription. Last summer, Netflix revealed that it had lost almost a million subscribers between April and the end of June as more people decided to quit the service.

(9, 'Lora Kolodny', 'Elon Musk calls U.S. media and schools ‘racist against whites & Asians’', '', 'Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter, accused “the media” and “elite colleges and high schools” of being “racist” against white and Asian people, espousing his views without providing evidence on Sunday. Musk posted his comments on Twitter, where he has nearly 130 million followers, in response to news that media organizations around the country decided to cut the comic strip “Dilbert” from syndication after its creator, Scott Adams, delivered a racist tirade in a video on his YouTube channel last week. In the video, Adams discussed a poll conducted by right-leaning Rasmussen Reports that said 26% of Black respondents disagreed with the statement “It’s OK to be white.” The phrase referenced in their poll has been labeled a “hate slogan” by the Anti-Defamation League. In his video, Adams called Black people who rejected that phrase as a “hate group.” Adams also said that he personally chose to live in a community where few or no Black people lived, and then advised his white viewers to “get the hell away from Black people,” saying he didn’t “want to have anything to do with them.” Adams’ video was published during Black History Month in the U.S., which was established in 1976 by President Gerald Ford as a period during which to honor the struggles and contributions of Black Americans. Among the news outlets that dropped “Dilbert” were the Los Angeles Times, The Oregonian, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Washington Post and USA Today. Musk’s track record Brian Levin, a civil rights attorney and director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University said, in response to Musk’s tweets: “Systemic racism requires not only widespread bigotry to be held within a group but also a structural component that allows discrimination and oppression to be imposed on a minority because of an advantage of access and power. A white billionaire from South Africa who recently lost a high profile racial discrimination case may not be in the best position to offer counsel.” As CNBC previously reported, a San Francisco federal court ruled that Tesla must pay a former worker, Owen Diaz, for damages after he endured a hostile work environment and racist abuse at the company’s factory where he previously worked as an elevator operator. Additionally, the EEOC, a federal agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws against workplace discrimination, has issued a cause finding against Tesla, according to a financial filing from the company last year. Prior to the EEOC finding, the California Civil Rights Department, formerly known as the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, sued Tesla after a three-year investigation, alleging widespread racist discrimination at Tesla factories and facilities across the state. The CRD alleged that Tesla has kept Black workers in lower-level roles at the company even when they have the skills and experience to be promoted to more senior roles; assigned Black workers more demanding, dangerous and dirty work in their facilities; and retaliated against Black workers who complained formally about what they endured, including racist slurs used by managers. Tesla called the CRD’s lawsuit “misguided,” and later countersued the agency. The data on racism Musk made his claims about “the media” and some higher educational institutions and high schools in the U.S. without presenting any evidence. Specifically, he wrote, “The media is racist.” He then added, “For a *very* long time, US media was racist against non-white people, now they’re racist against whites & Asians. Same thing happened with elite colleges & high schools in America. Maybe they can try not being racist.” According to Pew Research, newsroom employees are much more likely to be white (and male) than U.S. workers overall. In film and TV, according to McKinsey research, “Black talent is underrepresented across the industry, particularly off-screen.” Less than 6% of the writers, directors and producers of U.S.-produced films are Black, McKinsey found. According to the most recently available U.S. Census Bureau data, about 29% of non-Hispanic white people in the U.S. have attained a bachelor’s degree or higher levels of education, about 18.4% of Black people in the U.S. have attained that level of education, and about 51.3% of Asian people have done so. Despite Asian American educational attainment, Asians are underrepresented in leadership roles in U.S. academic libraries and higher education, according to research by Mihoko Hosoi, published in the Journal of Library Administration in 2022. Musk also replied to one Twitter account that said unarmed white people affected by police violence only get a fraction of the media attention paid to Black people injured or killed by police. Musk claimed that the media coverage is “Very disproportionate to promote a false narrative.” According to research by Brookings Institute, “Black people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to be killed by police', 'Elon Musk, CEO of Twitter, Tesla and SpaceX, accused “the media” and “elite colleges and high schools” of being “racist” against white and Asian people, espousing his views without providing evidence.

(10, 'Hugh Son', 'Why Goldman’s consumer ambitions failed, and what it means for CEO David Solomon', '', 'When David Solomon was chosen to succeed Lloyd Blankfein as Goldman Sachs\r\n CEO in early 2018, a spasm of fear ran through the bankers working on a modest enterprise known as Marcus.\r\n\r\nThe man who lost out to Solomon, Harvey Schwartz, was one of several original backers of the firm’s foray into consumer banking and was often seen pacing the floor in Goldman’s New York headquarters where it was being built. Would Solomon kill the nascent project?\r\n\r\nThe executives were elated when Solomon soon embraced the business.\r\n\r\nTheir relief was short-lived, however. That’s because many of the decisions Solomon made over the next four years — along with aspects of the firm’s hard-charging, ego-driven culture — ultimately led to the collapse of Goldman’s consumer ambitions, according to a dozen people with knowledge of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind Marcus — the transformation of a Wall Street powerhouse into a Main Street player that could take on giants such as Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan Chase\r\n — captivated the financial world from the start. Within three years of its 2016 launch, Marcus — a nod to the first name of Goldman’s founder — attracted $50 billion in valuable deposits, had a growing lending business and had emerged victorious from intense competition among banks to issue a credit card to Apple’s many iPhone users.\r\n\r\nSolomon at risk?\r\nBut as Marcus morphed from a side project to a focal point for investors hungry for a growth story, the business rapidly expanded and ultimately buckled under the weight of Solomon’s ambitions. Late last year, Solomon capitulated to demands to rein in the business, splitting it apart in a reorganization, killing its inaugural loan product and shelving an expensive checking account.\r\n\r\nThe episode comes at a sensitive time for Solomon. More than four years into his tenure, the CEO faces pressure from an unlikely source — disaffected partners of his own company, whose leaks to the press in the past year accelerated the bank’s strategy pivot and revealed simmering disdain for his high-profile DJ hobby.\r\n\r\nGoldman shares have outperformed bank stock indexes\r\n during Solomon’s tenure, helped by the strong performance of its core trading and investment banking operations. But investors aren’t rewarding Solomon with a higher multiple on his earnings, while nemesis Morgan Stanley\r\n has opened up a wider lead in recent years, with a price to tangible book value ratio roughly double that of Goldman.\r\n\r\nThat adds to the stakes for Solomon’s second-ever investor day conference Tuesday, during which the CEO will provide details on his latest plan to build durable sources of revenue growth. Investors want an explanation of what went wrong at Marcus, which was touted at Goldman’s previous investor day in 2020, and evidence that management has learned lessons from the costly episode.\r\n\r\nOrigin story\r\n“We’ve made a lot of progress, been flexible when needed, and we’re looking forward to updating our investors on that progress and the path ahead,” Goldman communications chief Tony Fratto said in a statement. “It’s clear that many innovations since our last investor day are paying off across our businesses and generating returns for shareholders.”\r\n\r\nThe architects of Marcus couldn’t have predicted its journey when the idea was birthed offsite in 2014 at the vacation home of then-Goldman president Gary Cohn. While Goldman is a leader in advising corporations, heads of state and the ultrawealthy, it didn’t have a presence in retail banking.\r\n\r\nThey gave it a distinct brand, in part to distance it from negative perceptions of Goldman after the 2008 crisis, but also because it would allow them to spin off the business as a standalone fintech player if they wanted to, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\r\n\r\n“Like a lot of things that Goldman starts, it began not as some grand vision, but more like, ‘Here’s a way we can make some money,’” one of the people said.\r\n\r\nIronically, Cohn himself was against the retail push and told the bank’s board that he didn’t think it would succeed, according to people with knowledge of the matter. In that way, Cohn, who left in 2017 to join the Trump administration, was emblematic of many of the company’s old guard who believed that consumer finance simply wasn’t in Goldman’s DNA.\r\n\r\nCohn declined to comment.\r\n\r\nParadise lost\r\nOnce Solomon took over, in 2018, he began a series of corporate reorganizations that would influence the path of the embryonic business.\r\n\r\nFrom its early days, Marcus, run by ex-Discover executive Harit Talwar and Goldman veteran Omer Ismail, had been purposefully sheltered from the rest of the company. Talwar was fond of telling reporters that Marcus had the advantages of being a nimble startup within a 150-year-old investment bank.\r\n\r\nThe first of Solomon’s reorganizations came early in his tenure, when he folded it into the firm’s investment management division. Ismail and others had argued against the move to Solomon, feeling tha', 'Many of the decisions Goldman CEO David Solomon made regarding Marcus ultimately led to the collapse of its consumer ambitions, according to a dozen people with knowledge of the matter.\r\nMarcus leaders had disagreed with Solomon over products, acquisitions and branding, said the people, who declined to be identified speaking about internal Goldman matters.\r\nThe humbling episode adds to the stakes of Solomon’s second-ever investor day conference Tuesday, in which the CEO will provide details on h', '2023-02-27', 4, 'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107200432-16775251851677525181-28371260867-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1677525832&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y', 'WORLD', 'https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/679/718/png-transparent-globe-world-font-awesome-icon-globe-miscellaneous-map-earth-thumbnail.png'),

And so it now collects far less data on that type of content, and also doesn\'t send personalised ads to people watching that content,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"The solution exists, they just need to pull it out of the toolbox.\"', 'Campaigner Duncan McCann has lodged an official complaint with the Information Commissioner\'s Office (ICO).\r\n\r\nHe says the site is gathering data about the videos children watch, where they are watching and what device they are watching it on.\r\n\r\nYouTube said it had invested in protecting families.', '2023-03-01', 6, 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/121CA/production/_128768147_duncanandsol.png.webp', 'UK', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Flag_of_Great_Britain_%281707%2C_3-2%29.svg/150px-Flag_of_Great_Britain_%281707%2C_3-2%29.svg.png'),

(17, 'Lucia Binding', 'Artificial intelligence can now pick out transplant organs \'more effectively than what human doctors can see\'', 'Newly developed artificial intelligence (AI) technology can now choose donor organs for transplant with much greater accuracy than humans, according to British researchers.\r\n', 'The National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) has put £1m in funding for the AI project, which can increase the number of organs available for transplant. Currently, surgeons examine donor organs and use their own judgement to assess whether they are of good enough quality to be suitable for transplanting into patients. But the fresh method uses AI and its \"memory\" of tens of thousands of images of donor organs to identify those that offer the best chance of transplant success. Ministers are backing the project, as well as NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) and the NIHR Blood and Transplant Research Unit. The team of experts behind the new phenomenon, known as OrQA - Organ Quality Assessment - claim it could result in up to 200 more patients receiving kidney transplants and 100 more receiving liver transplants every year in the UK. Work is ongoing to define the technology, but the team, which includes experts from the University of Oxford, believe it will deliver results for the NHS in the future. Professor Hassan Ugail, director of the centre for visual computing at the University of Bradford, whose team is designing the image analysis, told PA news agency: \"Currently, when an organ becomes available, it is assessed by a surgical team by sight, which means, occasionally, organs will be deemed not suitable for transplant. \"We are developing a deep machine learning algorithm which will be trained using thousands of images of human organs to assess images of donor organs more effectively than what the human eye can see. Advertisement \"This will ultimately mean a surgeon could take a photo of the donated organ, upload it to OrQA and get an immediate answer as to how best to use the donated organ.\" A key part of the OrQA assessment will be to look for damage, pre-existing conditions and how well blood has been flushed out of the organ. Colin Wilson, a transplant surgeon at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and co-lead of the project, said: \"Up until now, we haven\'t had anything to help us as surgeons at the time of organ retrieval. \"This is a really important step for professionals and patients to make sure people can get the right transplant as soon as possible. \"The software we have developed \'scores\' the quality of the organ and aims to support surgeons to assess if the organ is healthy enough to be transplanted.\"', 'The new method developed by experts uses AI and its \"memory\" of tens of thousands of images of donor organs to identify those that offer the best chance of transplant success.\r\n', '2023-03-01', 6, 'https://e3.365dm.com/23/02/1600x900/skynews-nhs-staff-hospital_6071761.jpg?20230227113917', 'WORLD', 'https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/679/718/png-transparent-globe-world-font-awesome-icon-globe-miscellaneous-map-earth-thumbnail.png'),

Newry Crown Court heard that in dispute over a £200-300 drug debt, 49-year-old James Gillen ordered his mate Aodhan McLarnon to lie down on the ground but when he refused, he shot him in the right upper thigh with a crossbow bolt. In a strange twist to the confused tale, it was Gillen who phoned the police at 4am on December 29th 2020 to tell them he’d shot Mr McLarnon in the groin, erroneously claiming he’d done it because his victim had come to his home to “do him harm” and that he’d been informed McLarnon had been paid £1,000 to do so. When police arrived at the scene, they found the heavily bleeding victim in a street nearby and although he told cops he jury his leg climbing over a fence, he admitted the truth and was taken to hospital where doctors stitches his leg back together, sealing the 11 cm wound with 16 stitches. Gillen, from Lagmore Avenue, Belfast was arrested and confessed: “I shot him in the balls, no problem, he wouldn’t get on the ground so I could kneecap him. There you go, I’ve claimed it…try to f**king do my family in, f**king 2p gangster.” When officers arrested him, they discovered an axe and a machete in a bag behind the door and also that in his pocket, he had a small silver knuckle duster. It was that axe, the court heard, that Gillen used to smashed every window in his victim’s Skoda car and to gouge the panels and paint work. Judge Peter Irvine KC said while Gillen “has a considerable record for violence…the prosecution do not make the case that this was a punishment attack, nor that it was carried out in behalf of a paramilitary organisation.”', 'A man who finished a three day drink and drug binge by shooting his mate in the leg with a crossbow was handed a seven and a half year sentence on Wednesday.', '2023-03-01', 1, 'https://focus.sundayworld.com/thumbor/_L-tSGysvOtHYgFSsKREQ-DHOpc=/0x0:3399x2550/960x720/prod-mh-ireland/b84eb820-ff64-4056-ab07-0be73b7d8abe/c9d0258e-b0b2-46f2-9e83-de571fc70882/b84eb820-ff64-4056-ab07-0be73b7d8abe.jpg', 'UK', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Flag_of_Great_Britain_%281707%2C_3-2%29.svg/150px-Flag_of_Great_Britain_%281707%2C_3-2%29.svg.png'),
